# Iteration 4:

Feature: gallery page
	As an officer/member
    I want to be able to view/edit a gallery
    So I can see all of the pictures the club hosts 

Background: member in database
	Given the following member exists:
	|name			| email							| major		| status	| is_officer	| sem_hours	| total_hours	|
	|Huda			| jdoe@berkeley.edu	            | CS	    | active	| 0				| 5			| 10			|
    |Phoebe         | phoebe@berkeley.edu           | CS        | active    | 1             | 0         | 10            |



Scenario: member likes a photo 
    
	When I go to the gallery page 
	And I like the photo "kitty.jpg"
	When I go to the profile page # you have small typo here earlier. you have extra Then
	Then I should see "kitty.jpg" in the gallery section of the profile page 
	
	
Scenario: officer is able to add photo 

    When I go to the gallery page 
    And I click the edit button 
    And I upload the photo "kitty.jpg"
    Then I should see "kitty.jpg" in the gallery section of the profile page 

Scenario: officer tries to upload something that's not a photo #sad path 
    When I go to the gallery page 
    And I click the edit button 
    And I upload the text file "Hi.txt"
    Then I should see "This is not a photo, please resubmit" in the gallery page
