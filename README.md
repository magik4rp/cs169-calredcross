A brief explanation of the customer's business:
Our customer is looking for a central platform to use for Red Cross Members. We
need to be able to keep track of important info such as events. Right now, they
use Callink, but that's not very intuitive to use. Members have to registered at
the official branch of Red Cross. They want a smaller database that has easy
access for information in the form of a website. They also went a separate
interface for officers to use. Some of the features they are looking for are to
make it easier to make events on the Calendar since the current one is too
lengthy (maybe embed a Google calendar). The officers want to be able to see all
members and edit the member status.They also want a photo gallery, and be able
to track member hours. There is no legacy code, we are starting from scratch.
