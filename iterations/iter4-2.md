Our iteration goals did not change. We accomplished all three of these features. 

We want a gallery page that displays all of the photos that the club wishes to post. 
The only people with this functionality should be officers, who can upload and delete
photos based on their choosing. We also want members to be able to like photos, and have
those photos show up on their gallery section. 

We also want a calendar page that displays all the events the club is hosting. On the 
person's personal profile page, we have a personal event section that shows only 
the club events that person is attending. 

We also want a home page that only officers can edit which announcements and Member
of the Month posts they can make.
